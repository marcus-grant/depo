    #     COMMENT:
    #     The old method prepopulated a custom User model using a configuration file and Django signals.
    #     This approach relied on reading external JSON configuration and creating users with custom fields.
    #     In contrast, this method utilizes Django's builtâ€‘in User model (accessed via get_user_model()),
    #     ensuring that the user is created with proper password hashing and permission flags.
    #     The post_migrate signal is still used, which is a standard way to perform such prepopulation,
    #     though some may opt to use a custom management command or data migration for more control.
