# Design documentation

This directory contains the authoritative design requirements for the project.

Design documents define:

- core invariants
- architectural boundaries
- version-specific scope

These documents are normative. If there is a conflict between
implementation and a design requirement, the design requirement wins.

## Documents

- [Design Requirements - MVP (v0.0.1)](./mvp.md)
  - Authoritative scope and invariants for the initial implementation
  - All MVP work must conform to this document

- [Design Requirements - v1.0](./v1.md)
  - Post-MVP direction and constraints
  - Explains why certain MVP decisions exist
  - Not to be implemented until the MVP is complete
  - This is a future reference not meant to be read till after MVP
    - With the one exception of better understanding architecture in MVP
