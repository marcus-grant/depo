# Depo

A minimal,
self-host-able paste-bin and short-content service designed around
**immutability**, **predictable URLs**, and **long-term links**.

This project is built for people who want a reliable place to share
text, code, notes, and images without
worrying that links will silently change or disappear.

## Documentation

Start here:

- [Documentation root](doc/README.md)

## Project status

This project is in active development.

- **v0.0.1 (MVP)** focuses on a correct, minimal foundation
- **v1.0** adds aliases, editing, invitations, and public-sharing readiness

The current Django implementation will remain available during the transition to
the new architecture.

## Scope

This repository contains the new implementation.
Legacy behavior and data live on legacy branches.
